# Task 2A: Mapping Places Mentioned in Gaza War Articles (Regex Method)

This project identifies and maps place names mentioned in news articles about the Gaza war starting from October 7, 2023. It uses a regular expression (regex) method together with a list of place names (gazetteer) to find and count how often each place is mentioned each month.
## Using Gazetteer and Regex to Find Places
In this part, we extracted all place names from the articles using a gazetteer (a list of known geographic locations). To find alternate spellings, we used regex (regular expressions). Then we counted how many times each place was mentioned in each month after the war started.

## Requirements
To run this project, we used:
we installed the following libraries on our python:
re (for regular expressions)
os (to work with files)
pandas (to organize and save data)
Git Bash for version control:
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git pull
git push


## How the Script Works

### Reading the Data
The script starts by loading libraries.
A function write_tsv() is defined to save results into a .tsv file using pandas.
It then loads the gazetteer (with alternate spellings in the 6th column).
Regex patterns are built for each place to include all its spellings.
Patterns are stored in a dictionary with their count set to zero.

### Analyzing Articles
The script reads all .txt files from the articles/ folder.
It skips articles published before October 7, 2023.
For each valid article, the script:
Finds mentions of place names using regex.
Ignores case sensitivity (e.g., “Gaza” = “GAZA”). Used IGNORECASE for this.
Counts total and monthly mentions.
Counts are stored in a dictionary grouped by month.

### Exporting Results
After processing, the script prints the monthly counts for each place.
These are saved in regex_counts.tsv using the earlier write_tsv() function.
